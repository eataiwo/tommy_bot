# Tommy

*Documentation in early development*

Tommy_bot is a mobile robot I am building for two main reasons: 
  Learning robotics 
  Create a platform to explore fun analogous to robotic systems that could be deployed at extra terrestrial habitats and settlements  

Tommy_bot is currently implmented using Python and ROS, evetually including C++. My orginial robot was written in pure Python. Impenenting ROS has advantages and disadvatages but the main reason I did it was for learning purposes, however I am very open to suggestions and tips if you think my implementations of things can be improved.
